    "# Lab 08 - Reading Binary Files (8 marks total)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have had seven labs with a lot of new programming concepts, we can focus on using some of the new tools to perform tasks that once seemed daunting with limited instruction. This lab will only require three functions to be written and will allow you to come up with a solution any way you like. In this lab, we will read structs from a binary file and create a schedule of events. The structs in the file will consist of individual events that form a schedule for an individual's work day, or even a venue scedule. The program written for this lab will be capable printing a schedule of these events. The exact format of the printed schedule will be shown below. Before starting to write the program, you will also need to create a binary file. This means you will need to hard code a create function for your own testing. The list below is a recap of the tasks to complete writing this program.\n",

    "3. The event only flows over to the next half hour if it is **strictly greater than** the amount of time. i.e. if commute above was 60 minutes, the time would not overflow and would only show 9 am.\n",
    "4. When you get to the afternoon, the time switches from a 24 hour clock to the 12 hour am/pm model.\n",
    "5. Remember to seek/set the file pointer to the file location where you would like to begin reading when a file pointer is passed. \n",
